# lorecosimdash

In order to run this code, the [v2.0-alpha.1 EconoSim.jl packag](https://github.com/HapponomyOrg/EconoSim.jl/releases/tag/v2.0-alpha.1) needs to be used. Using other versions of this package might not work.

This project contains code to run complementary money simulations where the complementary currency system is based on the Sustainable Money System developed by [Happonomy](http://happonomy.org).

The source code for these simulations can be found in the backend/simulation.jl file.
The simulations themselves are described and executed in a Jupyter file, LorecoSimulation.ipynb, which can be found in the jupyter folder.
The configuration files for the simulations are JSON files which can be found in the sim_configurations folder.
